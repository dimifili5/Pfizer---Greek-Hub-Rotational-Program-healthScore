# Pfizer---Hackathon

I created this simple website during Phizer's Rotational Graduate Program | Hackathon for Women.  The task was to create/implemet/launch a Hybrid Health App in 2 days. This is the website that holds the info on the product we designed.
The Hackathon was organised by Phizer's Digital and Tecnology Hub, in collaboration with AUTH University.


# healthScore App

My team and I built a hybrid healthcare app specialised for professional athletes. Smart wearables devices were used to support doctor's diagnosis.
The application allows athletes to schedule medical appointments with docotrs (psycologist/psychiatrist, nutritionist, cardiologist, pathologist, physiotherapist/orthopedics).
It also combines the data extracted from wearables (i.e. smart watch) with the profile information and personal history of the user to make valid predictions about his health condition.
This approach helps doctors make their diagnosis more accurate.
